# Programming with Python

A main focus of the course is to show you how to model and solve real-world problems. In order to do that, you'll need some programming abilities. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a great choice for this since it is widely-used and relatively easy to learn. You may have some experience with Python already, which is great! If you've never used Python before, don't worry. We'll spend a little time on the basics here, and we won't require you to do much out of the ordinary. Beginners will want to get some more practice outside of class.

## Google Colab notebooks

You can code Python in many different environments, but I think the easiest way to get started is with [Google Colab](https://colab.google/). This is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)-like[^jupyter] notebook environment that is free to use and requires only a web browser. I'll be using this in class to go through coding examples. Note that you'll do need a Google account in order to use Colab[^googleAccount].

[^jupyter]: It's not exactly like Jupyter, but the same in spirit. Also, don't worry if you don't know about Jupyter or coding notebooks yet.
[^googleAccount]: This shouldn't be a huge hurdle. If you don't have one already you can always create a burner account for the sake of the class.

In Colab (and other notebook environments) code is organized into cells where related blocks of code are written. You can execute code one cell at a time to work through the notebook and check outputs as you go. I'll use a Colab notebook in the next section to walk through some basics of Python.

## Some python basics

Below, you should see a read-only image of a Colab notebook. The notebook gives some exposition and samples of basic Python principles. Click the "Open in Colab" button to open a version of the notebook in a new window.

## Other coding environments

jupyter, vscode, pycharm, gitpod, google cloud ide.
