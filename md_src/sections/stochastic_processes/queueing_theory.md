## Queueing theory

The next area of stochastic processes we will study is __queueing theory__, which you could call the study of waiting in lines. The models we see here could be seen as a special class of (continuous-time) Markov chains, but the theory is well-developed outside of that formalism, so we won't be referring back to our Markov chain chapter here.

Examples from the textbook (e.g. edelman prize winners)
