# Stochastic processes

We're going to change gears a bit now to talk about stochastic processes. The word **stochastic** is just a fancy way to say "random", so we can say colloquially that a stochastic process is just a system that evolves according to the outcome of some random process. The nature of the work we do in this section is different from what we've done so far - we won't necessarily be _optimizing_ anything, but instead only describing and analyzing the evolution of some system. One could say that the nature of the techniques will be more _descriptive_ as opposed to _prescriptive_.

We will start this section with a review of the basics of probability and random variables. Then we'll be diving into two important classes of stochastic processes, Markov chains and queues. This background will be useful when we move on to Markov decision processes at the end of the course.

## Probability basics

We'll now use some time to review the basics of elementary probability theory. This material should be familiar to you from past probability or statistics courses.
