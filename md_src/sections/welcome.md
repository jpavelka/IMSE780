# Welcome!

You're reading the class notes for _IMSE 780: Methods of Operations Research_ taught at Kansas State University during the Fall 2023 semester. This course is intended to give an overview of Operations Research (OR) at the graduate level. After this course, students will have a basic familiarity with various OR methodologies and be able to recognize when the methods can be applied in real-life scenarios. Students should also be able to apply the chosen methodology via Python code.

## Course materials

The core of this course will be taught from these notes. Additionally, I encourage students to use the textbook _Introduction to Operations Research_ [@classText] as a reference[^bookVersion]. The syllabus, assignments, and other course materials may be found via the [class Canvas site](https://k-state.instructure.com/).

[^bookVersion]: The most recent version of this textbook is the 11th edition, which came out in 2021. But much of the content quoted here comes from the 10th edition from 2015. Nothing about the course will require you to have a certain edition, or any book at all. But I think it's a very useful reference.

## Notes on these notes

I wrote the notes in this format in an attempt to alleviate all my past frustrations from reading academic material in all formats. Things like unlinked references, or links requiring context switches and without back navigation. Or static elements that could be more effective if animated or interactive. So I tried to fix some of those issues with this format.

That means these notes were necessarily made with my desires in mind, and not yours, the reader trying to learn from them. So I'd love any feedback you have on how the notes are presented, or anything you think I could add to help your learning. I can't guarantee I'll be able to change much substantial at this point, but at the very least future iterations of these notes could incorporate your changes and help future learners.

Also, errors. I'm trying my best to keep these notes free of typos and factual errors, but inevitably several will slip through. I'd be grateful if you can point these out as you see them. I'll even keep a leaderboard of who has pointed out the most errors, and will have a prize at the end of the semester for the largest contributors.

I made these notes mostly for consumption on your web browser on a laptop/desktop computer, or a tablet in landscape orientation. You can still access them on your phone, of course, and I've tried to style things such that the content is as usable as possible on a narrow screen, but your best experience will be on a larger screen. If you'd like hard copies of these notes, your only option for now is to print from your browser. With some extra work, I could make pdf versions available as well, although you will necessarily lose some functionality in that format. If this is something you'd be interested in, please let me know.
