## From theory to practice

<!-- reading solver logs -->
<!-- how big is M (make it too big and the lp relaxation is larger) -->
<!-- lazy constraints (as an extension of cutting planes)-->
<!-- symmetry -->
<!-- mip starts -->
<!-- python examples (some of the above, gurobi logical constraints) -->
