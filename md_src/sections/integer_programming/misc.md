## Practical miscellany

<!-- reading solver logs -->
<!-- how big is M (make it too big and the lp relaxation is larger) -->
<!-- lazy constraints (as an extension of cutting planes)-->
<!-- symmetry? -->
<!-- mip starts -->
<!-- using NEOS server -->
<!-- python examples (some of the above, gurobi logical constraints) -->
