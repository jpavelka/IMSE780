You are each required to complete a project in which you apply knowledge from the class to a topic of your choosing. The content of the project will be determined by each student, and as such there are few formal requirements. Exact parameters need to be agreed upon between the student and professor ahead of time. There are two phases to the project, each with their own deliverable: the planning phase where you determine the focus of the project and discuss it with the professor, and the final project itself.

If you're a Ph.D. student or a Master's student writing a thesis, you may choose a project related to your research. Similarly, if you work on OR related projects as a part of your job, you may choose one of your work projects (so long as your company is ok with me knowing some details, make sure to check with your manager or HR department). This should, however, be _new_ work, not a project that was completed in the past (though if you'd like to base it on a prior project but extend it in some way, that could be fine).

Below are some sample ideas of what might make up your project:

- Apply some methods from class to solve a real-world problem: Identify a situation where you believe an OR method can provide useful solutions to some problem (could be work or research related). There should be some baseline difficulty to the problem (in the judgement of your professor), either due to complicated data gathering, tricky modeling, or a combination of these and other factors.
- An examination of a case study from literature: Find a paper with an interesting OR application. Your project would involve some combination of: thoroughly explaining the case study, critiquing the methodology, and replicating some portion of the work using methods from class.
- Literature review: Choose a topic and identify 3+ papers in the literature discussing it. Your project would be to synthesize the work into one cohesive review, comparing and contrasting different parts of the papers and examining how they relate to topics covered in class. This may also involve a small case study or replication of work from the papers.
- Code an implementation of a method learned in class: Write a computer program that fully and correctly executes an algorithm learned in class.

As mentioned, there are two phases to the project, each with its own requirements and deliverables, which are outlined below.

<h2>Project planning (20% of grade, due 11/17)</h2>

In this phase, you should determine the focus of your project and discuss it with the professor. You are **required** to schedule a session with the professor (~15 minutes, in person or via Zoom/Teams) to discuss your ideas and come to an agreement on parameters of the final deliverable. After meeting with the professor, you must also write up a brief proposal document (ideally no longer than one page typed, but it could be longer if you include tables/images) outlining the content of the project and what will be delivered. The document should be submitted via the "Project Planning" assignment on Canvas.

<h2>Final deliverables (80% of grade, due 12/8)</h2>

This is where you complete the final project deliverables, as determined in the planning phase. Submissions should be given through the "Final Project" assignment on Canvas.
