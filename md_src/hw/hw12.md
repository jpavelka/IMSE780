1. (5pts)** Three white and three black balls are distributed in two urns in such a way that each contains three balls. We say that the system is in state $i$, $i = 0, 1, 2, 3$, if the first urn contains $i$ white balls. At each step, we draw one ball from each urn and place the ball drawn from the first urn into the second, and conversely with the ball from the second urn. Let $X_n$ denote the state of the system after the $n$th step. Explain why $\{X_n\}$ ($n = 0, 1, 2,...$) is a Markov chain and construct its (one-step) transition matrix.

1. (5pts)* Consider a stock market model where whether a certain stock goes up tomorrow depends upon whether it increased today _and_ yesterday. If the stock increased today and yesterday, it will increase tomorrow with probability $\alpha_1$. If the stock increased today and decreased yesterday, it will increase tomorrow with probability $\alpha_2$. If the stock decreased today and increased yesterday, it will increase tomorrow with probability $\alpha_3$. Finally, if the stock decreased today and yesterday, it will increase tomorrow with probability $\alpha_4$.

     Initially, it might seem like this scenario cannot be modeled as a Markov chain, since what happens in the future (tomorrow) depends upon what happened in the past (yesterday) as well as the present (today). But this actually can be modeled as a Markov chain by expanding the number of states considered. Model this as a Markov chain with 4 states by constructing the (one-step) transition matrix.


1. (4pts)* Given the following (one-step) transition matrices of a Markov chain, determine the classes of the Markov chain and whether they are recurrent.
    a.
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 0 & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{2}{3} \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$ 
    b.
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
    0 & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
    \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2}
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

1. (6pts)* An important unit consists of two components placed in parallel. The unit performs satisfactorily if one of the two components is operating. Therefore, only one component is operated at a time, but both components are kept operational (capable of being operated) as often as possible by repairing them as needed. An operating component breaks down in a given period with probability 0.2. When this occurs, the parallel component takes over, if it is operational, at the beginning of the next period. Only one component can be repaired at a time. The repair of a component starts at the beginning of the first available period and is completed at the end of the next period. Let $X_t$ be a vector consisting of two elements $U$ and $V$, where $U$ represents the number of components that are operational at the end of period $t$ and $V$ represents the number of periods of repair that have been completed on components that are not yet operational. Thus, $V = 0$ if $U = 2$ or if $U = 1$ and the repair of the nonoperational component is just getting under way. Because a repair takes two periods, $V = 1$ if $U = 0$ (since then one nonoperational component is waiting to begin repair while the other one is entering its second period of repair) or if $U = 1$ and the nonoperational component is entering its second period of repair. Therefore, the state space consists of the four states (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1). Denote these four states by $0, 1, 2, 3$, respectively. ${X_t} (t = 0, 1, . . .)$ is a Markov chain (assume that $X_0 = 0$) with the (one-step) transition matrix

     $$
     \begin{bmatrix}
     0.8 & 0.2 & 0   & 0 \\
     0   & 0   & 0.2 & 0.8 \\
     0   & 1   & 0   & 0 \\
     0.8 & 0.2 & 0   & 0
     \end{bmatrix}
     $$

    a. What is the probability that the unit will be inoperable (because both components are down) after $n$ periods, for $n = 2, 5, 10, 20$?
    b. What are the steady-state probabilities for this Markov chain?
    c. If it costs \$30,000 per period when the unit is inoperable (both components down) and zero otherwise, what is the (long-run) expected average cost per period?
