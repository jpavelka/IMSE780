1. (2pts) The knapsack problem is an optimization problem one might term as: "Given a set of items, each with a value and a weight, and a weight limit for your backpack, what is the maximum total value of items you can fit into your backpack?". Please give a similar description, but this time for the decision version of the knapsack problem.
