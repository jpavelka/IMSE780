- (2pts) walk through local max + concave = global max proof
- (2pts) are these functions concave? why? 3x - 2x^4, (1/6)x^3 - (1/6)x^4
- (4pts) another bisection search (13.4.2a, but make them determine the bounds)
- (4pts) bisection search example (book 13.4.1, pdf p606)
- (4pts) newton's method example  (same as above)
- (4pts) find point where gradients equal zero, are they local/global optima? (13.5.2, 13.5.4)
