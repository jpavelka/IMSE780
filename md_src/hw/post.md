<h1 id='pyInstructions'>Instructions for submitting Python assignments:</h1>

For the portions of assignments that require you to submit Python code, I'll accept submissions in one of the following modes:

1. (Preferred) A link to a Colab notebook. Any `pip` installs or other dependency downloads should be included in the notebook. Starting with Homework 2, __I'll only accept these submissions if I have been added as an editor__ of the notebook, which allows me to see the document's revision history (to make sure nobody changes their code after I've graded it in an attempt to gain more points). To do this (steps illustrated below), click on "Share" in the upper-right portion of the screen. Then enter my gmail address (jeffp171@gmail.com) where it says "Add people and groups", and in the drop-down to the right select "Editor".

2. Upload a file through Canvas. If you code using Colab and would like to submit your Colab notebook as a file, you can download a copy from the Colab menu by choosing File > Download > Download .ipynb.
3. Copy the Python code directly into the Canvas submission.

If you choose option 3, or choose option 2 with a file besides the Colab notebook, make sure to mention in a comment somewhere if I need to install any libraries or other dependencies to run your code.
