1. (5pts)* Starting from the initial trial solution $(x_1, x_2) = (1, 1)$ work through two iterations of the gradient search procedure for the problem
$$
\max \quad f(\x) = 4x_1x_2 - 2x_1^2 - 3x_2^2
$$
While completing the iterations, fill in a table like we did in the class notes.
1. (5pts)* Starting from the initial trial solution $(x_1, x_2) = (0, 0)$, apply _one_ iteration of the gradient search procedure to the following
problem:
$$
\max f(x) = 4x_1 + 2x_2 + x_1^2 - x_1^4 - 2x_1x_2 - x_2^2
$$
To complete this iteration, approximately solve for $t^*$ by applying _two_ iterations of the bisection method with initial
bounds $\underline t=0$, $\overline t=1$. Fill out tables for both methods.
1. (5pts)* Consider the following convex programming problem:
$$
\begin{align*}
\max && -x^4 - x^2 + 4x \\
\st  && x&\leq 2 \\
     && x&\geq 0
\end{align*}
$$
Use the KKT conditions to find an optimal solution for this model.
1. (5pts)* Consider the following quadratic program:
$$
\begin{align*}
\max && 8x_1 - x_1^2 + 4x_2 - x_2^2 \\
\st  && x_1 + x_2 &\leq 2 \\
     && x_1, x_2 &\geq 0
\end{align*}
$$
Set up and solve the problem via the modified simplex method. Be sure to mention explicitly which variables enter and exit the basis in each iteration.
